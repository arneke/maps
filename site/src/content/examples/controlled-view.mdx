description: |
  In this example, the `<View>` component is given a `center` and `zoom`.  These
  props can be updated to update the state of the view.  The view is also given
  an `onChange` callback.  This function is called after the view state changes.
  In this example, the callback is used to update component state and render the
  view properties at the bottom of the map.
