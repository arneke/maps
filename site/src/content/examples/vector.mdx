title: 'Vector Layers'
level: 1
description: |
  This example shows two vector layers using data from GeoJSON sources.  The
  layers are given a `style` prop that controls the styling of vector features.
  The sources are given `url` and `format` options for fetching and parsing
  the data.

  The style for the urban areas vector layer can be controlled by clicking on
  the "gray" and "red" buttons.  The `useState` hook is used to maintain the fill
  color for this layer, and clicking on the buttons updates this state.
